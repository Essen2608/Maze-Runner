# Maze-Runner
Solves a maze given to it.
- Uses a modified version of Depth-First-Search so it can search through the Maze.
- This version does not guarantee the finding of the shortest path.
## Upcoming Major Changes
- [ ] Create a weighted graph from the Maze.
- [ ] Use Union-Find to check if a path is available or not.
- [ ] Use Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path.
- [ ] Create a provision where it would take images of Maze as an input, preprocess it, after that the weighted graph would be made.
- [ ] Deploy it using a webpage where one would upload the image and get the result.
